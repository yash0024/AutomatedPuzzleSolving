# AutomatedPuzzleSolving
 Allows the user to play three games: Sudoku, WordLadderPuzzle, and ExpressionTreePuzzle. I have also coded a Solver class capable of solving any of the three puzzles using Depth-first search and Breadth-first search algorithms. Wrote code to determine if a given sudoku puzzle is solvable, and if it has a unique solution.
